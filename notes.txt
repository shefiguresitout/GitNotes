git init in the directory containing files turns it into a repository
top directory has a .git file where all git info is stored.  Completely independent of any other repo


# ********************************
# Messages
# ********************************

Best practice:
one line for small change (< 50 characters)
one line summary plus multiple lines for larger changes (< 72 characters)

# ********************************
# git log
# ********************************
git log shows these messages
git log --stat shows which files changed in each commit
git log -n <#> or just git log -<#>  # shows # commits
git log -since=<date> -until=<date> -Author=<name>  #  after and before are synonyms for since and until
# date form is YYYY-MM-DD or can be things like "2 weeks ago", "3 days ago", etc.
git log --grep="<regex>"
git log --oneline # gives compressed version
git log --format=oneline # shows full sha
git log --graph --oneline [master <branch>] --decorate # gives visual representation of commit history
git log <filename> # show just commits for that file
git log -p # shows diffs
git log --format=short|medium|full|fuller|email|raw # medium is default

git show <SHA> # shows what happened in a commit
# ********************************
# Workflow
# ********************************
Typical workflow:
edit file(s), add file(s), commit change

git add puts the file(s) into a staging area; can add . or an individual file
git commit puts the contents of the staging area into the repository
That way if you don't want to put everything you've changed into the repository, only those files that
have been added to the staging area will be committed to the repository

commits are identified by SHA-1 checksum of the changes which validate that the data hasn't changed.

commit -m "message" adds the message without needing to go into the editor
commit -a does add and commit together, but doesn't handle deletions and new files; git add then git commit would handle them
The head is a pointer to the tip of the currently checked out branch *in the repository*.

git status shows the difference between the working directory, staging index, and repository

every commit stores id of its parent.  commit doesn't care about branches.

# ********************************
# git diff
# ********************************

git diff with no arguments compares files in working directory to files in staging area that haven't been added
git diff --staged compares files in staging area with files in most recent commit
git diff id1 id2 shows differences between commits with ids id1 and id2
git diff id1 id2 <filename> shows changes to just that file
git diff -b # ignores # of spaces changes
git diff -w # ignores all white space changes
git diff <branch1>..<branch2> --colorwords

# ********************************
# Undoing Changes
# ********************************

To remove or rename a file:
git rm <filename>
git mv <filename>

To undo a change:
git checkout -- <file_or_dirname> # The -- says get files from the current branch
checking out a commit means resetting all of your files to how they were at the time that commit was made.

To unstage a file:
git reset HEAD <filename>
If you accidentally add a file to the staging area, you can remove it using git reset.
For example, if you accidentally add lesson_2_reflections.txt, but don't want it to be committed yet, run
git reset lesson_2_reflections.txt
and the file will be removed from the staging area, but it will still be in your working directory.

To unstage everything that's in the staging area:
git rm --cached 

To modify the very most recent commit:
git commit --amend

To undo back to an older commit:
git revert <SHA>

To irreversibly undo all changes since last commit:
git reset --hard discards any changes in the working directory and the staging area.  
This is not reversible because changes were never committed.  Can't get changes back.

git reset --hard HEAD~1 removes the last commit you've made.

git reset --soft moves HEAD pointer, doesn't change staging index and working directory
git reset --mixed moves HEAD, clears staging index

git reset --hard origin/master resets the current branch to be the same as the last git pull

To get rid of untracked files:
git clean -n # shows what would be removed
git clean -f # forces the removal to happen

# ********************************
# Ignoring files
# ********************************
.gitignore in root working dir
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitconfigfiles/.gitignore_global # sets up global ignores
Ignoring a file that's already in the repo, leaving it in the repo, leaving it in the wd:
    put it in .gitignore
    git rm --cached <filename>

Git doesn't keep track of directories, only files.  To have git track an empty directory, it has to have 
a file in it.  People do this with:
touch .gitkeep
in the empty directory

# ********************************
# Navigating the commit tree
# ********************************
<SHA|HEAD>^ is previous commit
<SHA|HEAD>~<#> is #th previous commit
<SHA1>..<SHA2> is a range of commits

# ********************************
# Branching
# ********************************
master is the main branch, autocreated by git
A branch is a label for commit

git branch shows branches; the current branch is starred
git branch <branchname> creates a new branch
git checkout <branchname> makes that the branch being operated on
git checkout -b <branchname> # creates and switches to a branch
git branch --merged # shows all branches completely merged into a branch
git branch -m|--move <branchname> # renames a branch
git branch -d <branchname> # deletes branch if it's merged into current branch
git branch -D <branchname> # deletes branch even if it's not merged into current branch and commits could be lost
deleting a branch after merging it into another branch just removes the label.  All the commits are still there.
deleting a branch without merging it into another branch discards its commits- they all become unreachable.


if you check out a branch then make a commit, the branch label autoupdates to the new commit, and stays checked out.  
Current last commit in a branch is the tip of that branch.

A given commit can have multiple branch labels, but a new commit will only affect the branch which is checked out.

checking out an old commit without creating a branch gives detached head state:
if you
   -check out a commit that's not at the tip of a branch,
   -make a new commit from there, and
   -don't create a branch, then
   -checkout an existing branch,
   that commit is not reachable by any branch.
   It's lost unless you save its id.  Git log won't show it.

git checkout master brings you back to the tip of the master branch if you checked out an older commit and 
have a detached HEAD.

# ********************************
# Merging
# ********************************
To merge branch2 into branch1:
git checkout <branch1>
git merge <branch2>

git merge <branch1 branch2...> merges all specified branches into currently checked out branch, so you 
should always check out the branch you want to point to the new commit.

git merge keeps all lines that are in both files
removes a line that was in the original file and removed in one version
adds a line that wasn't in the original file and was added in one version

fast-forward merge: branch1 hasn't changed since branch2 was created, so can simply move the HEAD for branch1 
to the HEAD of branch2.  No new commit created.

git merge -noff # creates a new commit if you want to add a comment at the merge point
git merge -ffonly # don't do the merge if you can't do a fast-forward merge

If there are merge conflicts:
can do:
git merge --abort
or manually edit file(s).  Git marks conflicts for you in the files with arrows and = signs
Then git add <file(s)>
and git commit

Best practices:
Merge often
"Track changes to master:"
Merge master into your branch fairly often


# ********************************
# Stashing changes
# ********************************
To save changes you're not yet ready to commit:
git stash save "<message>"
Often used when you want to switch branches but aren't ready to commit your changes
Also used if you made a change in the wrong branch because stash is available in all branches
git stash list # shows what's in the stash
git stash list -p # does a git diff with most recent commit
# Items in the stash are denoted @{<#>} 

git stash pop @{<#>} # brings files out of stash into working directory; pulls first files by default, which are @{0}
git stash apply @{<#>} # brings files into working directory, but leaves them in the stash
# Items brought out of the stash are put in whatever working directory and branch you're currently in
git stash drop stash@{<#>} # gets rid of an item in stash
git stash clear # gets rid of everything in stash

# ********************************
# Working with remotes (remote repositories)
# ********************************

Remotes are exactly like branches
origin/master is also exactly like a branch except that you can't check it out

Workflow:
Do commits locally
Fetch latest from server
Sync origin branch
Merge new work
Push up to remote


Create our own repository:
git remote add <remotealias> <url> # adds a remote; creates a mechanism by which can establish
# connection with a remote
# primary remote called origin, but this is just an alias; can be anything.
# multiple remotes should have different names

git remote # lists remotes git knows about
git remote rm <remotealias> # removes remote

Push puts a local branch on a branch of the remote repository
git push -u <remotealias> <branch>
# -u says you're tracking the remote; don't have to specify <remotealias> and <branch>
# when doing fetches and pushes
git push -u origin <localbranch> creates a new branch on the remote called <localbranch>
Work with someone else's repository:
git clone is how you work with an existing repository


git branch -r # shows remotes
git branch -a # shows local and remote branches

Branches other than master remain private unless pushed to the remote
Master branch is what's cloned by default, though that's configurable.
Can use -b to specify which branch you want to clone

# origin/master is just another repository.  It doesn't sync with the remote unless you tell 
# it to with:
git fetch origin
# This brings it into origin/master, not local master.  origin/master is just a local 
# cached version of what's in the remote repository.  Best practice to fetch often. 

# Have to merge master into origin/master:
git merge origin/master

git pull 
# is a shortcut for:
git fetch
git merge
# If there's been a change in the remote since you last fetched, you'll need to pull before you can push.

git push <remotealias> --delete <branch> # deletes the remote branch

To get a branch other than master from a remote:
git branch <newbranch> <remotealias>/<otherbranch>
git checkout -b <newbranch> <remotealias>/<otherbranch> #creates new branch from remote and also
# checks it out
git branch <newbranch> <commit> # commit defaults to head, but could be any commit, including a 
# remote one.



# ********************************
# Edit this into the notes:
# ********************************

repository has most recent commit
staging area is copy of most recent commit until changes added
working directory is copy of most recent commit until changes made to file(s)


remote branch is created by someone else
Git sorts commits based on the time they were created.


git show shows the changes introduced between (?? the current) commit and its parent

git show commit_id shows the changes introduced between a commit and its parent


git checkout master
git merge master <branchname>
This will make the merged branch the master

You could check out a different branch, in which case the label for the checked out branch will point to the new 
merged commit

git merge uses the commit at point where the branches diverged and the contents of the branches being merged.



git gc does garbage collection for git, removing unreachable commits

GitHub
------

To create a remote repository on GitHub:
Click the plus sign and select "new repository"
git remote add origin https://github.com/shefiguresitout/GitNotes.git
git remote add <repositoryname> <url>
standard is to name single remote origin
url comes from the github page where new repository was created
git push -u origin master
git push <remote> <local branch>

what you send and receive from remotes is commits, but instead of selecting each individual commit, the most common way to send and receive data is by specifying a branch.  This will cause all of its commits to be sent.  Only new commits will be sent, not those that are already in the remote.  Commits that are not reachable from the specified branch also will not be sent.

git remote [-v] views and creates remotes

git push origin <branch>
git pull origin <branch> pulls down changes made on GitHub

by default, the remote branch will have the same name as the local branch
when you have a remote branch, git stores a local copy of it.  
The local copy contains the state of the remote branch as of the last time you pushed or pulled it.
the local copy of the remote branch is called origin/<branchname>, eg origin/master.
git push updates the local orgin/<brachname> branch and the remote github branch to the latest commit in the local branch
git pull updates the local branch and the local origin/<branchanem> if the remote github branch is updated
git fetch updates just the local copy of the remote branch, origin/<branchname>, leaving local version alone.
If there are changes on the remote, and changes to the local version, this allows you to use log and diff to see what's changed on both the local and remote repositories without updating your local version.
You can then merge the changes from the remote repository into the local repository with
git merge <branch> origin/<branch>

git pull origin <branch> is equal to:
git fetch origin
git merge <branch> origin/<branch>

can create and edit plain text files on github
git pull is used when there have been changes on github that aren't in the local repository


forking allows you to make a copy of somebody else's repository directly on github, without pulling down to your local machine first.  
Can then pull down the code to your local machine unless files are simple enough to edit directly on github.  
Links back to the original repository
Forking is a lot like cloning; fork is a clone GitHub makes for you on their machines.  Keeps link back to original repo.  Keeps track of how many people have forked.  Makes it easy to make changes to original repo.
To create a fork, go to the page for the repo; click the fork button in the upper right corner.
fork only happens on github: making a copy of an existing github repository
cloning happens on a local machine or between github and a local machine.  It makes a copy of an existing repository

when you clone a repository, github automatically sets up a remote pointing to the repository you cloned from

settings>collaborators><github username> allows other users to push to your repository

fast forward merge: branch you're merging into is an ancestor of the branch you're merging from; taking a label from somewhere in a branch and moving it to the tip

Collaborate:
make change locally in separate branch
push that branch to github:
git push origin <separate-branch>
create pull request by checking out the branch and clicking on pull request, click edit to the right

pull request asks to merge my changes into someone else's repository, ie asking that person to pull my changes into their repository
