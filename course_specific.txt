git clone https://github.com/udacity/asteroids.git
Have to do: git checkout coins before trying the first merge

Double check the state of your files. If you run git log while the master branch is checked out, you should see Caroline's
"Add color" commit as the second-most-recent, and the most recent should be your commit fixing the bullet bug.
If you use git diff to compare your commit to Caroline's, your commit should introduce the line
this.delayBeforeBullet = 10; on line 424.
The line should be indented to the same level as the line below it using only spaces (no tabs), and the line should have no spaces after it.
